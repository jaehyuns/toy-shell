# toy-shell
Work environment is Ubuntu18.04.
The cd function is executed as soon as you enter a directory without the cd. and enter code.pp.c
Implemented the clear and exit functions.
The text color was changed to yellow and blue.
The path is displayed on the command line to check the cd.
pwd,ls functions can be implemented without /bin/.
The cp function creates a file, but becomes a segmentation fault. It seems to be touching something other than the allocated memory.
